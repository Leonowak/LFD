# How to Install Dependencies
This README provides instructions on how to install the necessary dependencies for running various models for text classification. The models mentioned include Bag of Words (BoW), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Pre-trained Language Model (PLM).

To run the models, the following dependencies are needed:
## Bag of Words:

    scikit-learn
    nltk

and can be installed using pip:

    pip install scikit-learn nltk

## LSTM

    tensorflow, numpy, scikit-learn

and can be installed using pip:

    pip install tensorflow numpy scikit-learn

## Pretrained language models

    transformers

and can be installed using pip:

    pip install transformers
